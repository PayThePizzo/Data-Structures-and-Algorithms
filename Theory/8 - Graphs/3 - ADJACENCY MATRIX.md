# Adjacency Matrix
Given that the vertices have distinct numbers as labels, for this implementation we use 
a $|V| \times |V| = n \times n$ **matrix** $A_{G} = a_{i,j}$, where:

```math
a_{i,j} = 
\left\{\begin{matrix}
0 & (i,j) \notin E & \text{ No edge between i and j} \\
1 & (i,j) \in E & \text{Edge between i and j} \\
\end{matrix}\right.
```

## Quick Recap - Matrix Operations

### Matrix Multiplication - Dot Product

Given two matrices

* $A = n \times m$ and,
* $B = m \times k$ 

$$\text{i.i.f } \, m = m \Rightarrow A \times B = C = n \times k$$

and

$$c_{i,j} = \sum_{l=1}^{m}a_{i,l} \cdot b_{l,j}, \text{ with } i = 1, \ldots, n \wedge j = 1, \ldots, k$$

## Undirected Graphs

Example for directed and undirected graphs:

### Properties of $A$

Let G be an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, let's consider its Adjacency Matrix $A$ and see if we can find any properties

For undirected graphs:

* $a_{i,j} = 0$ when $i = j$
  * Since self-loops are absent, the main diagonal is filled with 0
* $A^{T} = A$, the matrix is symmetric
  * Because edges do not have a direction.
* $a_{i,j} = a_{j,i} \forall i,j = 1,2, \ldots, n$.
  * As the matrix is symmetric
* $deg(i) = \sum_{j=1, \ldots, n} a_{i,j}$
  * The degree of a vertex is given by the sum of the i-th row

### Properties of $A^{2} = A \times A$

We can do $A \times A = A^{2}$ which is product of two matrices.

```python
A = [   [0,1,1,1],
        [1,0,1,0],
        [1,1,0,1],
        [1,0,1,0]]

AxA = [ [3, 1, 2, 1]
        [1, 2, 1, 2]
        [2, 1, 3, 1]
        [1, 2, 1, 2]]
```

### 1 - Main diagonal of $A^{2}$

We notice that, the numbers on the main diagonal, $[3,2,3,2]$ represent the degrees of the vertices. More generally:

$$\forall i = 1, \ldots, n : a^{2}_{i,i} \in A^{2} = deg(i)$$

#### Demonstration

By definition of dot product:

```math
a^{2}_{i,i} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} \cdot a_{l,i}
```

Then

```math
a^{2}_{i,i} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} \cdot a_{l,i} = deg(i)
```

By property of symmetry, since $A$ represents an undirected graph $a_{i,l} = a_{l,i}$

```math
a^{2}_{i,i} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l}^{2} =  \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{l,i}^{2} = deg(i)
```

While, as we stated before, the degree of a vertex $i$ is given by the **sum of the** $i$-th **row**

```math
\sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} = deg(i)
```

Which means

```math
a_{i,i}^{2} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l}^{2} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} = deg(i)
```

Then, since we only have $1$ and $0$ inside $A$ the summation executes exactly the sum of the i-th row's elements.

* The graph is undirected and non-weighted!

```math
a_{i,l}^{2} = a_{i,l}
```

In fact,

```math
a_{i,l} = 0 \Rightarrow a_{i,l}^{2} = 0  \wedge a_{i,l} = 1 \Rightarrow a_{i,l}^{2} = 1
```

We conclude that:

```math
a_{i,i}^{2} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} = deg(i), \forall i = 1, \ldots, n
```

### 2 - Elements outside the main diagonal of $A^{2}$
Now, we consider the elements outside the main diagonal

```math
\forall i,j = 1, \ldots , n \ni' i \neq j: a_{i,j}^{2} = \, \text{ count of paths of length 2 between i and j }
```

#### Demonstration

By definition of dot product:

```math
a^{2}_{i,j} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l} \cdot a_{l,j}
```

By construction of $A$, $a_{i,j} = 0 \vee a_{i,j} = 1$ for undirected non-weighted graphs. Then,

```math
a_{i,l} \cdot a_{l,j} \neq 0 \Leftrightarrow a_{i,l} = a_{l,j} = 1
```

By definition of $A$, this is possible only if there exist two edges
* One going from $i$ to $l$
* One going from $l$ to $j$

```math
a_{i,l} = a_{l,j} = 1 \Leftrightarrow (i,l) \in E \wedge (l,j) \in E
```

![edgeexists](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/edgeexists.png?raw=TRUE)

By definition of path, and length of path, the existence of a sequence of vertices connected through some edges,
defines a path of length equal to the number of edges. In this case, there is a path of length $2$ from $i$ to $j$

We conclude that this is true.

### 3 - Elements outside the main diagonal of $A^{k}$

This previous concept can be generalized to paths of length $k$

```math
\forall i,j = 1, \ldots, n \ni' i \neq j: a_{i,j}^{k} = \text{ count of paths of length k between i and j}
```

#### Demonstration by induction
Steps:
1. Base Case:
2. Inductive Hypothesis: True, check previous section
3. Inductive Step: Demonstration for $k \geq 1$

For $k \geq 1$

Trivially, 

```math
A^{k} = A \cdot A^{k-1}
```

By definition of dot product:

```math
a^{k}_{i,j} = \sum_{l=1}^{n} a_{i,l}^{1} \cdot a_{l,j}^{k-1}
```

By construction of $A$, $a_{i,l} = 0 \vee a_{i,l} = 1$ for undirected non-weighted graphs. 

By Inductive Hypothesis, the count of paths of length $k-1$ between $l$ and $j$ is given by $a_{l,j}^{k-1}$

We conclude this is true.

## Directed Graphs

TODO: Check SP Problems for solutions (FW)

Example for weighted graphs:

![wadjmat](https://github.com/PayThePizzo/DataStrutucures-Algorithms/blob/main/Resources/wadjmat.png?raw=TRUE)

### Properties of $A$

Let G be an directed graph $G=(V,E)$, let's consider its Adjacency Matrix $A$ and see if we can find
any properties

For directed graphs:

* $in-deg(i) = \sum_{l=1, \ldots, n} a_{i,l}$
* $out-deg(i)= \sum_{l=1, \ldots, n} a_{l,i}$

### Properties of $A^{2} = A \times A$

### Properties of $A^{k}$

```math
a_{i,j}^{k} = \sum_{l=1}^{m} a_{i,l} \cdot a_{l,j} = \text{ the count of paths of length k from i to j}
```

## Space

Always requires $S(n) = \Theta(n^{2})$

## Time

Access to information is immediate $T(n) = \mathcal{O}(1)$

### Conclusions
We may prefer an adjacency-matrix representation, when the graph is dense or when we need to be able to tell quickly
if there is an edge connecting two given vertices
