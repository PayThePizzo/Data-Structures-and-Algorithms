# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo follows the topics of the following courses for students of [Laurea triennale in Informatica](https://www.unive.it/pag/3/) 
at [UniversitÃ  Ca' Foscari di Venezia](https://www.unive.it/):
* [Mod. 1](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339889) 
* [Mod. 2](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339890)

>[!NOTE] Anyhow, I took the liberty of adding extra content for a better comprehension of the course.

## Contents

### General Theory
* Asymptotic notions
* Temporal and Spatial Complexity
* Solving occurrences
* Decision Problems and NP-Hardness

### Data Structures
I will include the following data structures, their primitives, and some of their declinations:
* Trees
* Heap
* Priority Queues
* Tables
* Graphs

I do not include (for now), some basilar data structures and their implementations such as:
* Sets
* Array
* Stack
* Queues
* Lists and their declinations.

### Algorithms
I will try and implement the algorithms to make immediately runnable.
* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms

---

## Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms

I will only use C++ and C to implement the pseudocode.

I will add specific sections to give credit when due, but I recommend to buy the books and follow a university level course
in order to understand these concepts better.
