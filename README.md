# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo follows the topics of the following courses for students of [Laurea triennale in Informatica](https://www.unive.it/pag/3/) 
at [Università Ca' Foscari di Venezia](https://www.unive.it/):
* [Mod. 1](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339889) 
* [Mod. 2](https://www.unive.it/data/insegnamento/339890)

Anyhow, I took the liberty of adding extra content for a better comprehension of the course.
Eventually this project will be extended to include advanced data structures and algorithms.

## General Theory
* Asymptotic notions
* Temporal and Spatial Complexity
* Solving occurrences
* Decision Problems and NP-Hardness

## Data Structures
I will include the following data structures, their primitives, and some of their declinations:
* Trees
* Heap
* Priority Queues
* Tables
* Graphs

I do not include (for now), some basilar data structures and their implementations such as:
* Sets
* Array
* Stack
* Queues
* Lists and their declinations.

## Algorithms
I will try and implement the algorithms to make immediately runnable.
* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy Algorithms

---

## Implementation

The implementation technique will be done in C++/C

### TODO:
* Retouch:

We will add specific sections to give credit when due, but we recommend to buy the books and follow a university level course
in order to understand these concepts better.

If you feel like any of the content is yours and/or should be removed, please contact me immediately.
